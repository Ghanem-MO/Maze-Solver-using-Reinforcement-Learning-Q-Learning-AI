Maze Solver using Reinforcement Learning
• Description: Develop a reinforcement learning-based agent that learns to navigate a maze efficiently. The agent should start with no knowledge of the maze and learn through trial and error the optimal path to the exit using reward feedback.
• Key Concepts: Reinforcement Learning, Q-learning, Policy Gradient Methods, Exploration vs. Exploitation.
• Simulation Platform: OpenAI Gym with a custom maze environment.
